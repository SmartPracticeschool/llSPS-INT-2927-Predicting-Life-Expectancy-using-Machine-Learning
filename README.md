Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning

This Machine Learning Project was completed under Remote Summer Internship Program 2020 by SmartBridge.

In this project, the average life expectancy of a person is predicted by using python and AutoAI. The WHO dataset of life expectancy is used to make predictions- which is downloaded from kaggle.com. The dataset connects various factors like schooling, measles, polio, etc to life expectancy and shows the average expectancy of a country given certain parameters that the user inputs. The model is trained trained using a Random Forest Regressor model. 

The project uses services of IBM Cloud. Watson Studios and Watson Machine Learning service are used to deploy the model (python). Then user interface is connected using Node Red application. 

Secondly, an AutoAI experiment is conducted on the dataset, where the model is prepared automatically by the service. This is also deployed on NodeRed, and both UI's give comparable answer to each other and to the actual dataset.

Here is the link to the Nodered apps:
